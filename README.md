# Hi! I'm LilyLambda 

- I'm a smash modder and a beginner programmer.
- You'll mostly find smash modding source code here, but there may be a few other projects on the account as well
- If there's source code you'd like added to GitHub, feel free to ask and I'll add it when I get the chance
- If you ever need to reach me, I'll respond quickest on discord, **@LilyLambda**
