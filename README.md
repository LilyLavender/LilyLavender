# Hi! I'm LilyLambda 

- I'm a smash modder and currently in my second year of a Web & Software Development program.
- You'll mostly find smash modding source code here, but there's a few other projects as well
- If there's source code you'd like added to GitHub, feel free to ask and I'll see what I can do
- If you ever need to reach me, I'll respond quickest on discord, **@LilyLambda**
