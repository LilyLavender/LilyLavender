# Hi! I'm Lily

- I'm a freelance developer, SSBU modder, and currently in my second year of a Web & Software Development program.
- Here you can find various projects I've worked on, ranging from websites, to software, to SSBU mods
- If the source code for one of my projects isn't here, feel free to ask and I'll see what I can do
